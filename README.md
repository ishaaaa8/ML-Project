## ðŸ“ˆ Project Overview

The **Student Performance Prediction** project predicts the math score of a student based on multiple input features. The dataset used for this project is [Student Performance in Mathematics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/student-performance-in-mathematics) from Kaggle.

### Key Features:
- **Web Application**: A Flask app that allows users to input data and get predictions.
- **Data Pipelines**: Two pipelines created for predictions and training the model.
- **Logging & Exception Handling**: Using custom utilities to handle errors and log each step.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained and saved as `model.pkl` for prediction.

## ðŸ§° Skills & Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application.
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing machine learning logic.
- **Pandas** & **Numpy**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building the machine learning model and performing predictions.
- **Logging**: Custom logging mechanism to store logs in a file.
- **Pickle**: Saving the trained model and preprocessing steps.
- **HTML** & **CSS**: For building the form in the Flask frontend.
- **Exception Handling**: Using custom exceptions for error management.
